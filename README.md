#Oct2Julia

This repo will try to identify some tricks for running Octave files from Julia REPL using the PyCall and Oct2py modules from Julia and Python.

Well... Many years without saying anything. It was really just ‘practicality’. I left Julia and continued using Python and Octave. Julia took a path that wasn't convenient for me. 

I had (I still have) hundreds of Python and Octave scripts from many years ago, and Julia's initial good ideas took the path of developing its own independent language, abandoning the more common use of other functions that had already been designed and developed and only needed to be reimplemented as they were, but changing names, functionalities, and, in my opinion, going backwards on the path already travelled by many. 

New forms/ways do not always get the best results from new and good ideas.
